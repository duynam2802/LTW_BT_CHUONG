        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to the home page of our family farm, Sunny Acres, where
          there's always something happening. With the coming of fall, we're
          gearing up for our big Autumn Festival and Farm Show. If you haven't
          visited our famous Corn Maze, be sure to do so before it gets torn
          down on November 3. This year's maze is bigger and better than ever!
        </p>
        <p>
          Farms can be educational and Sunny Acres is no exception. Schools and
          home-schooling parents, plan an afternoon with us at our Petting Barn.
          We have over 100 friendly farm animals in a clean environment. Kids
          can bottle feed the baby goats, lambs, and calves while they learn
          about nature and the farming life. Please call ahead for large school
          groups.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the sun goes down this time of year, we're all looking for a good
          fright. Sunny Acres provides just that with another year of the
          Haunted Maze. Please plan on joining us during weekends in October or
          on Halloween for our big Halloween Festival.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, Sunny Acres is above all, a farm. Our Farm Shop is always
          open with reasonable prices and great produce. Save even more money by
          picking your own fruits and vegetables from our orchards and gardens.
        </p>
        <p>We all hope to see you soon, down on the farm.</p>
